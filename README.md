### Game Screen

The user presses `H` to hit the card or `S` to stand. The score will update automatically. If the user chooses to stand, the dealer will reveal their hand. The dealer must keep hitting until their score is equal or higher than 17. Everytime a card is dealed, the sound of dealing a card will play.

## Credits

This game is our final project for the course CS6010 at [MSD](https://msd.utah.edu) program. Thanks [Varun Shanker](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~shankar/) for designing such a comprehensive course with many well-designed assignments and labs. 

## Story behind ...

Yue: Do you have any idea for the final project?

Sai: Car race.

Yue (misheared car as card): Card game? Cool! Then we can use our code for Poker assignment! 

Sai: Sounds great. Let's do it!

Yes, this project starts from a mistake. ðŸ˜†
